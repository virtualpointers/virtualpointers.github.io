        <h1 class="text"> About Me </h1>
        <p class="text"> My name is Hashim, and this is my website! This is my first project so dont judge please. </p>
        <p class="text"> My family is from Jordan (north of Saudi Arabia, I always have to tell people that.), but I was born in Chicago. I am fluent in both Arabic and English.</p>
        <p class="text"> I like to play games and do normal things people my age do, and I've been picking up programming latley. I like to think I do good in school, and my favorite subjects include Math, Physics, and Chemistry. I know I'm a bit of a nerd you dont need to tell me that.</p>
        <p class="text"> I wouldnt be able to answer you if you asked my what my best language is, I'm just starting out, and I'm not by any metric a pro at any of them. Some of the languages I've tried include: C++, C, Python, and obviously HTML and CSS. If you would like to help me out, (or for some reason need MY help), my contacts are below.</p>
